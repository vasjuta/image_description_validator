# Image-Text Validation: Baseline Approach

## System Design
The project follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

```/src```
- ```data/```: Dataset handling and preprocessing
- ```models/```: CLIP-based baseline model implementation
- ```training/```: Training pipeline with early stopping and metrics tracking
- ```evaluation/```: Comprehensive evaluation suite
- ```inference/```: User-friendly API for model usage
- ```utils/```: EDA and logging utilities

```scripts/```: Entry points for training, evaluation, and inference

```tests/```: Basic unit tests

## Dataset Analysis and Model Choice

### EDA Findings
Our exploratory data analysis revealed several key characteristics:

1.Dataset Structure:
- 58,000 image-text pairs total
- Significant class imbalance: 84.5% non-matching vs 15.5% matching pairs
- All images standardized to 256x256

2.Text Properties:
- Highly structured descriptions (67.5% start with "a")
- Average length: 10.4 words, 52.5 characters
- Common starting words suggest focus on object quantities ("two", "three", "several")

3.Image Properties:
- Consistent 256x256 dimensions
- Organized in 60 folders (00000-00059)

### Baseline Approach & Design Choices
## Model Architecture:
- CLIP-based backbone with classification head
- Features:
  * Image and text embeddings from CLIP
  * Concatenated feature vector (CLIP embeddings + similarity score)
  * Multi-layer classification head with dropout
- Reasoning:
  * CLIP provides strong pretrained image-text understanding
  * Architecture handles both exact matches and semantic similarity
  * Efficient for both training and inference

## Training Strategy:
- Weighted BCE loss to handle 84.5/15.5 class imbalance
- Learning rate: 1e-4 with AdamW optimizer
- Early stopping on validation F1-score
- Frozen CLIP weights to prevent catastrophic forgetting

## Usage

### Data Analysis
```bash
# Run exploratory data analysis
python scripts/run_eda.py /path/to/dataset
```

### Training
```bash
# Train the model with default parameters
python scripts/train.py /path/to/dataset

# Train with custom parameters
python scripts/train.py /path/to/dataset \
    --output_dir outputs \
    --batch_size 32 \
    --num_epochs 10 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4 \
    --patience 3
```

### Evaluation
```bash
# Evaluate trained model
python scripts/evaluate.py /path/to/dataset \
    path/to/trained_model.pt \
    --output_dir outputs

# This will produce:
# - metrics.json: Detailed performance metrics
# - error_analysis.csv: Analysis of misclassified examples
# - evaluation.log: Detailed evaluation log
```

### Inference
```bash
# Command-line inference
python scripts/inference_client.py \
    path/to/model.pt \
    path/to/image.jpg \
    "image description"

# API Usage
from src.inference.api import ImageTextValidator

validator = ImageTextValidator("path/to/model.pt")
result = validator.validate("path/to/image.jpg", "image description")
```

### Potential Improvements
## Model
1. Error Analysis
2. Data augmentation for better generalization
3. Experiment with unfreezing CLIP layers
4. Ensemble approaches combining different CLIP variants

## System
1. Inference optimization for production deployment
2. Preprocessing pipeline improvements:
   - Extract transform logic to a configurable component
   - Store and version preprocessing configurations with model artifacts
   - Add validation to ensure inference-time transforms match training
3. More thorough error handling and logging throughout the codebase
4. Containerization
